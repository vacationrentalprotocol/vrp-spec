# Vacation Rental Protocol (VRP)

**The Vacation Rental Protocol (VRP) is an open protocol for host-domain-signed vacation-rental offers: an AI agent discovers a property on the open web, fetches a cryptographically signed (Ed25519, did:web) stay offer from the host's own domain, verifies it against the domain's JWKS, and books directly — no central marketplace, registry, or gatekeeper.**

Created and maintained by Rouiada Abbas. Anyone may implement it; HemmaBo is the reference implementation. Current public draft: v0.1.

The `vacation-rental.json` well-known URI suffix is registered in the [IANA Well-Known URIs registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/) (provisional, 2026-08-19).

VRP lets AI agents verify that a stay offer came from the host-owned domain, includes fresh availability, exact pricing, and a direct booking URL before quoting.

Core VRP proves the offer is real. Portable attestations prove selected trust history without making HemmaBo, or any other operator, the authority over truth.

## What VRP Is

- An open protocol for vacation rental offer verification
- A versioned protocol (`protocol_version: "0.1"`)
- A host-owned domain model for source identity
- Signed verified stay offers for machine validation
- Ed25519 JWKS for key discovery and signature checks
- Freshness control via `valid_until`
- Exact price fields for quote fidelity
- Safe-to-quote guardrails for agent behavior
- A no-gatekeeper trust model where verifiers choose their own trust policy

## What VRP Is Not

- Not a marketplace
- Not an OTA
- Not a booking portal
- Not a ranking engine
- Not a payment processor
- Not a central issuer, trusted issuer registry, or accreditation program
- Not a replacement for host websites

## Interop Position

VRP is deliberately narrower than a full booking or commerce stack. It can
compose with UCP for checkout and order lifecycle, including lodging flows as
the UCP lodging profile matures, AP2 for payment mandates, MCP for future tool
exposure, and A2A for future agent-to-agent bindings. VRP v0.1 does not define
those runtime flows.

Self-issued host-domain attestations are appropriate for domain-control, node,
payment-path, and policy facts. Claims that need independent evidence, such as
guest identity or right-to-let, belong in future optional third-party credential
profiles where each verifier chooses which issuers to trust.

## Reference Implementation

[HemmaBo](https://hemmabo.com) is a reference implementation, provider, and federation using VRP-compatible host-owned domains.

## For Coding Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex)

- Publish three documents on the host's own domain: `/.well-known/jwks.json`, `/.well-known/vacation-rental.json`, and the offer endpoint it names, e.g. `/api/verified-stay-offer`.
- Do not invent a schema — use [`spec/v0.1.md`](./spec/v0.1.md) and [`schemas/`](./schemas/) verbatim.
- Do not proxy booking through a marketplace — `direct_booking_url` stays on the host's domain.
- Prove interop with the [conformance vectors](./examples/conformance/) (`npm test`).

The HemmaBo MCP server is an implementation-specific integration, not a VRP
runtime tool defined by the v0.1 specification.

## Security

Report a vulnerability and read the scope in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md). Deeper
notes live in [`docs/security/`](./docs/security/):

- [Threat model](./docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md) — STRIDE-oriented, focused on Ed25519 signing, JWKS, host-domain-as-source-of-truth, and a compromised host key.
- [Key rotation](./docs/security/KEY_ROTATION.md) — additive rotation per spec §3.1, and the current verified live-node key posture.
- [Incident response](./docs/security/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) — handling a compromised host key or JWKS.

## License

VRP uses a dual-license boundary (ADR 0010 D7), so the standard is free to implement while the reference code carries an explicit patent grant:

| Path | License | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spec/`, `schemas/`, `contexts/`, this `README` and the site pages | [CC0 1.0](./LICENSE) (public domain) | The **specification text** and machine-readable spec artifacts — copy and implement the standard freely. |
| `scripts/`, `examples/` (incl. `examples/conformance/` vectors) | [Apache-2.0](./LICENSE-CODE) | The **reference verification code** and **conformance test vectors** — Apache-2.0, which includes the royalty-free patent grant (§3). |
