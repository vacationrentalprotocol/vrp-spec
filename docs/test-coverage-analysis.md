# VRP Spec — Test Coverage Analysis

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Scope:** `vacationrentalprotocol/vrp-spec` (protocol specification, JSON Schema, JSON-LD
context, example payloads, and the published website).

This document analyzes the current automated-verification coverage of the
repository and proposes prioritized areas for improvement. It is an analysis and
backlog, not a set of finished tests.

## Follow-up status

The first validation gate now exists: `npm test` parses JSON/JSON-LD artifacts,
validates Portable Attestations examples against
`schemas/attestations-v0.1.schema.json`, and runs negative privacy/proof
guardrails. This follow-up adds core schemas for discovery, JWKS, signed
offers, and verifier results. Real Ed25519/JWS conformance vectors now also
exist under `examples/conformance/`, verified end-to-end by `npm test` together
with their failure modes (tampered payload, unknown `kid`, wrong key, expired
`valid_until`).

The high-value gaps identified in this document now have automated coverage in
`npm test`: core artifact schemas, real JWS offer vectors, real signed
attestation-credential vectors verified against an issuer `did:web` document,
three-state conformance, context/vocabulary consistency, status-list round
trips, privacy negatives, and public route/link checks.

## Baseline before validation PRs

Before the first validation PRs, the repository had **no automated tests and no
CI**:

- No `package.json`, test runner, or test directory.
- No `.github/workflows/` — nothing runs on push or pull request.
- The only machine-readable validation artifact is
  `schemas/attestations-v0.1.schema.json`, but nothing exercises it.

What ships in the repo that *is* mechanically checkable today:

- 1 JSON Schema (`schemas/attestations-v0.1.schema.json`, Draft 2020-12).
- 1 JSON-LD context (`contexts/v1.jsonld`).
- 13 example JSON payloads under `examples/` (8 attestation, 5 core/protocol).
- Normative spec text with explicit `MUST`/`SHOULD` rules in `spec/v0.1.md`
  and `spec/attestations-v0.1.md`.
- A static website (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `terms.html`) and routing
  config (`vercel.json`).

Baseline observations from a one-off manual check (not yet automated):

- All 8 attestation examples **currently validate** against the attestations
  schema. This is good — but it is not guarded, so it can silently regress.
- The two `verified-stay-offer.*` examples have **divergent shapes** (see
  Gap 3 below) and are covered by **no schema at all**.

## Coverage gaps and proposed test areas

### Priority 1 — Stand up a CI validation gate (foundational)

Everything below depends on having a place to run checks. Add a GitHub Actions
workflow (and a thin `package.json` or a Python script) that runs on every PR
and:

- Asserts every `*.json` / `*.jsonld` file parses as valid JSON.
- Validates each `examples/attestations/*.json` against
  `schemas/attestations-v0.1.schema.json` (e.g. `ajv-cli` or Python
  `jsonschema`).
- Fails the build on any error.

This converts the currently-implicit "the examples happen to be valid" into an
enforced invariant. It is the single highest-leverage addition.

### Priority 1 — Schema coverage for the *core* protocol artifacts

The JSON Schema only covers the Portable Attestations layer. The core VRP
artifacts defined normatively in `spec/v0.1.md` §2–§5 have **no machine-readable
schema**:

- Discovery document (`spec/v0.1.md` §2 — required: `protocol`,
  `protocol_version`, `canonical_domain`, `jwks_url`,
  `verified_stay_offer_endpoint`). Example: `examples/discovery.v0.1.json`.
- JWKS (`§3`). Example: `examples/jwks.v0.1.json`.
- Signed verified stay offer envelope + payload (`§5`). Examples:
  `examples/verified-stay-offer.*.json`.

Proposed: author `schemas/discovery-v0.1.schema.json`,
`schemas/jwks-v0.1.schema.json`, `schemas/verified-stay-offer-v0.1.schema.json`,
and `schemas/verified-stay-offer-verification-result-v0.1.schema.json`, then
validate the core examples against them in CI. Without these, the most important
interop surface (what an agent actually fetches and verifies) is unguarded.

### Priority 2 — Example/spec drift (already-present inconsistencies)

Tests would have caught these baseline issues; follow-up validation now covers
the resolved structure:

1. **Two incompatible `verified-stay-offer` shapes.**
   `verified-stay-offer.not-quoteable.v0.1.json` is the *signed-offer envelope*
   shape (`kind`, `protocol_version`, `offer`, `signature`).
   `verified-stay-offer-verification-result.safe-to-quote.v0.1.json` is a
   different *verification-result* shape (`verified`, `agent_citation`,
   `official_offer_summary`, `agent_guardrails`). These are now named as
   distinct object kinds and pinned by separate schemas.

2. **Signed payload missing `SHOULD` fields.** The `not-quoteable` offer
   previously omitted `request` and `property`, which `spec/v0.1.md` lists in
   the signed payload. The example now includes them, and the signed-offer
   schema validates their shape when present without making SHOULD-level fields
   mandatory.

### Priority 2 — Schema ↔ context ↔ vocabulary consistency (done)

`contexts/v1.jsonld`, `schemas/attestations-v0.1.schema.json`, and the
repository copy of the `/terms` vocabulary page (`terms.html`) now stay in
lockstep through CI validation:

- Every VRP term used by the Portable Attestations schema has a matching term
  in `contexts/v1.jsonld`.
- Every `vrp:` term in the context has a corresponding anchor in `terms.html`,
  and every vocabulary anchor has a context definition.

Still useful later:

- Full JSON-LD expansion with a JSON-LD processor.

### Priority 2 — Cryptographic / JWS test vectors (done)

Signing and verification (compact JWS, EdDSA over Ed25519) is the heart of the
protocol. The placeholder examples elsewhere (`"<compact JWS>"`,
`"<base64url-public-key>"`) are now complemented by real, verifiable vectors:

- `examples/conformance/` holds a real (test-only) Ed25519 key pair, a signed
  offer, and the matching JWKS. `scripts/verify-conformance-vectors.mjs` does a
  genuine end-to-end Ed25519 verification in CI.
- Negative vectors are covered: signature over a mutated payload, `kid` absent
  from JWKS, a different key for the same `kid`, and an expired `valid_until`
  (valid signature but not fresh). These directly back the §7/§8 rules.
- `examples/conformance/attestations/` holds a real (test-only) signed
  attestation bundle plus the issuer `did:web` document.
  `scripts/verify-attestation-vectors.mjs` verifies each credential compact JWS
  against the DID document and enforces the `spec/attestations-v0.1.md` §8
  steps (typ/alg, context, type, validity window, no embedded proof) plus the
  same negative cases (tampered payload, unknown `kid`, wrong key). The
  attestation key is a separate test key from the offer key, exercising the §3
  offer/attestation key-separation rule. The `compactJws` values in
  `examples/attestations/attestation-bundle.v0.1.json` remain non-cryptographic
  shape placeholders.

This gives independent implementers something concrete to test their verifiers
against, which is the whole point of an interop spec.

### Priority 3 — Behavioral / conformance vectors for agent rules (done)

`spec/v0.1.md` defines precise behavioral `MUST`s (Safe-to-Quote §7,
Fail-Closed §8, Three-State Verification §9) and `examples/three-state-
verification.md` already works through four scenarios in prose. These are now
covered by machine-readable fixtures plus one explicit fresh positive case:

- `discovery-timeout-is-unknown`
- `invalid-signature-is-unknown-for-quoteable-facts`
- `expired-valid-until-is-not-fresh`
- `fresh-available-offer-is-affirmed`
- `fresh-explicit-unavailable-is-negated`

`npm test` runs `scripts/verify-three-state-fixtures.mjs` against
`examples/conformance/three-state-verification.v0.1.json`, keeping the prose
examples honest and giving implementers a concrete behavioral conformance suite.

### Priority 3 — Status list / revocation round-trip (done)

`spec/attestations-v0.1.md` §6 and `examples/attestations/status-list.v0.1.json`
define revocation/suspension. `npm test` now checks that every example
credential's `credentialStatus` resolves through `statusListUrl` / `statusRef`
into the example status list, that issuer and purpose match, that
`credentialStatus.id` is `statusListUrl#statusRef`, and that each referenced
status yields a defined state (`valid` / `revoked` / `suspended`).

Negative checks cover missing status refs, issuer mismatch, purpose mismatch,
duplicate status refs, and mismatched status-entry fragment IDs.

### Priority 3 — Privacy guardrails as explicit negative tests (done)

The schema already forbids guest PII in `VRPVerifiedStay` subjects (`not`
clauses for `guestName`, `guestEmail`, `checkIn`, `guestScore`, etc.). `npm
test` now mutates the verified-stay example with every forbidden guest identity,
exact-date, review, outcome, risk, score, and history field, and asserts that
each payload fails schema validation.

### Priority 4 — Docs, links, and deployment routing (done)

- `npm test` runs `scripts/check-public-routes.mjs`.
- The check validates Markdown cross-references, canonical URLs in `README`,
  `llms.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`, local route resolution through `vercel.json`,
  and expected Vercel `Content-Type` headers.
- `npm run check-public-routes:live` can be run after deploy to confirm sitemap
  URLs answer `200` on `https://vacationrentalprotocol.com` with the expected
  content types.

## Suggested sequencing

1. Done: CI workflow + JSON parse + attestations-schema validation (P1).
2. Done in follow-up: core-artifact schemas (discovery, JWKS, signed offer,
   verifier result) + validate examples (P1).
3. Done: resolve the `verified-stay-offer` shape drift and add negative PII
   fixtures (P2).
4. Done: real JWS test vectors + signature verification in CI (P2).
5. Done: context/vocabulary consistency checks (P2-P3).
6. Done: three-state conformance fixtures (P2-P3).
7. Done: link checking and Vercel route checks (P4).
8. Done: status-list round-trip checks (P3).

Steps 1–2 alone move the repo from "examples are validated by hand, sometimes"
to "every PR proves the published artifacts are internally consistent," which is
the core promise of an interoperability spec.
